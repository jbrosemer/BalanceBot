# BalanceBot
Balance Robot for Tufts University ME134
Imagine a cute little robot on two wheels, he kind of looks like Wall-E but he is a jerk. That is this project.
Two continuous servos a pseudo PD controller and an ESP to read IMU data, and you've got yourself a robot that twerks for you, very cute.
